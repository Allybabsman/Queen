Web development is one of the most popular areas of computer science, and for good reason. It's a versatile field that can be used to create a wide variety of websites. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn how to design and build a basic website, or an experienced developer looking to create something more complex, this article will teach you the basics of web development. You'll learn about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as the different frameworks and tools that are available to you. So if you're interested in learning how to build websites, read on!

What is website development?
Website development is the process of designing, building, and maintaining a website. Websites are essential for businesses of all sizes to connect with customers and build a brand. There are many different types of website development, including web design, web development, and online marketing.

Web design is the process of creating a website from start to finish. This includes coming up with the idea for the website, designing the website's layout and graphics, developing the website's content, and ensuring that the website is accessible and user-friendly.

Web development is a broader term that refers to both web design and online marketing. It encompasses everything from creating a basic website to building an online shopping platform or e-commerce store. Web developers may also help you with SEO (search engine optimization), social media management, and email marketing campaigns.

Web Development Basics
To get started in web development, you need to understand some basic concepts. Start by learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What is  HTML?
HTML is the foundation of all websites. It's a simple markup language that allows you to style your website's content and structure. You can use HTML to create pages with text, photos, videos, and embedded objects (like ads).

What is CSS?
CSS is a powerful tool for styling your website's text , images , and video . You can use CSS to change the color, size, and layout of your website's elements.
JavaScript is a programming language that you can use to create interactivity in your websites. You can use JavaScript to add buttons, menus, pop-ups, and other features to your website.

What is a web server?
Next, you need to learn about web servers. A web server is the computer system on which your website lives. It provides the necessary hardware (like an Internet connection) and software (like HTML5) for you to create and access your website.

What is coding?
Coding is the process of turning a computer program into a tangible form that can be executed by a machine. This can be done one of two ways: through programming languages or development platforms.

Programming Languages:
Programming languages allow you to create executable code using specific commands and symbols. There are thousands of different programming languages available, but some of the most popular include Java, C++, Python, and Ruby on Rails.

Development Platforms:
Development platforms are essential for creating software applications. They provide an environment in which you can write code, test it against errors and bugs before release, manage your project team remotely from anywhere in the world with ease (or on-site if needed), and deploy your finished application onto web servers or mobile devices.

What is an IP address?
An IP address is a unique identifier that is assigned to each device on the internet. It is used to identify and track devices through the network, and it is also used for routing traffic. IP addresses are divided into two categories - private and public. A private IP address is used only by the device that owns it, whereas a public IP address can be accessed by any device on the internet.

What is cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting your computer and data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. There are a number of different ways to achieve cybersecurity, including using antivirus software, keeping up with updates for your operating system and applications, installing firewalls and password managers, and encrypting your data.

Types of Web Development
There are three main types of web development: front-end development, back-end development, and full stack development.

Front-end development
Front-end development is the process of designing, building, and testing the visual part of a web or mobile application. Front-end developers create interfaces that are used by users to interact with a system. They work with both visual and functional design, as well as user experience and accessibility.

Front-end development can involve a variety of programming languages, design tools, and testing frameworks. Some common front-end development tasks include the following:

1. Designing and developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
2. Developing and testing web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Developing responsive designs for varying screen sizes.
4. Building custom animations and 3D effects for websites or applications.
5. Conducting usability tests to evaluate the effectiveness of a website or application's user interface.

Back-end development
Back-end development is the process of designing, coding, and testing the functionality of a web application's back-end - the part of the system that handles requests from users and interacts with databases. This includes everything from developing the system's architecture to writing code to support user authentication and data storage.

Back-end developers work in close collaboration with front-end developers, who design and create the user interface for a website or app. Together, they form the entire front-end/back-end development pipeline.

Back-end development is a critical component of web application development, as it ensures that the system works as expected and meets all requirements. It is also responsible for ensuring that all data is stored securely and accessible by users.

If you want to become a back-end developer, you will need to have strong programming skills and knowledge of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. You will also need to be comfortable working in a collaborative environment and be able to work independently as well as adhere to deadlines.

Full-stack development
Full-stack development is the process of developing a web application from start to finish, including the design, development, testing and deployment of all the necessary components. This includes everything from the back-end to the front-end, and can be done using a variety of languages and frameworks. Full-stack development is becoming more and more common in today's world, as it offers developers the ability to build applications in a more holistic way that allows for greater flexibility and efficiency.

The Website Development Process
Website development can be broken down into four main steps: Research, Design, Development, and Testing.

1. Research - Once you've determined what you want your website to look like and what features you need, it's time to do some research. This includes reading online articles, visiting different websites, and talking to friends and family about what they think would be a good website for your business.

2. Design - After you've gathered your research material, it's time to start designing your website. This phase involves creating a layout, developing graphics and logos, and creating content. It's important to remember that the design of your website should be consistent with the look and feel of your brand.

3. Development - Once the design is finalized, it's time to start coding! This phase involves creating the actual website codebase and working on features such as pages, menus, widgets, etc. Make sure to test your website frequently in order to ensure that everything is working as intended.

4. Testing - Once development is complete, it's time to test the site by loading it with users and checking for any possible errors. Make sure to correct any problems before you release the site to the public

What are the skills required to become a web developer?
As a web developer, you will need to be able to understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, you will need to be familiar with a variety of front-end development frameworks such as Bootstrap or Foundation. Finally, you will need to be skilled in managing and deploying web applications.

There is no one right way to become a web developer - the important thing is to develop the skills required for the specific job you want. If you are interested in developing web applications, for example, you should learn about different programming languages and frameworks. Alternatively, if you are interested in designing and developing websites, you should focus on learning HTML and CSS. There is no “wrong” way to become a web developer - it all depends on your interests and career goals.

Some courses and tools that'll help you!
If you want to learn more about web development, there are a number of courses and tools available that can help. For example, Code Academy offers a full course on web development that covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WordPress. Additionally, Codecademy provides interactive lessons that teach you how to code using various programming languages. Finally, Udacity offers online courses in front-end development (HTML5 &CSS3), back-end development (PHP & Ruby on Rails), and DevOps ( Linux & CI/CD). While there is no one right way to become a web developer, these resources can help you develop the skills and knowledge required for the job. Make sure to check them out and correct any errors before you release your site to the public!

Confusion Between the Terms: Internet and Web
Many people use the terms Internet and World Wide Web (a.k.a. the Web) interchangeably, but in fact, the two terms are not synonymous.
The Internet and the Web are two separate but related things. They are both very different.
So, the first thing to do is clear up the uncertainty between the two words.

 

The Internet
The Internet is a massive network of networks or a networking infrastructure. It connects millions of computers globally, forming a network in which any computer can communicate with any other computer as long as they are both connected to the Internet.
Information that travels over the Internet does so via a set of rules known as protocols.
The Web (World Wide Web)
The World Wide Web, or simply the Web, is a way of accessing information through the medium of the Internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top of the Internet. The Web uses the HTTP protocol, one of the languages spoken over the Internet, to transmit data.

Web Architecture
The Web can be summarized as a series of interactions between two types of systems, clients and servers.

 

Clients
•	Clients are the user’s devices that request and render web content. Clients can be: browsers, mobile applications, TVs, ect.
•	We live in an increasingly connected world and the number of clients that can access web content is growing rapidly.
•	Clients are not connected directly to the Internet.
•	Clients are connected to the Internet through their ISP (Internet Service Provider).

 


Servers
•	Servers are programs or systems that run on a special computer ( with special hardware like network equipment and dedicated network access).
•	Their job is to deliver data, resources, or services to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
•	There are different types of servers such as web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers. These specialize in specific types of data or specific processing capabilities. They’re all involved in providing the content that you request or the services that you need to perform.
•	Servers are connected directly to the Internet and the web pages (content) are stored on that server’s hard drive.

Protocol
Network protocols are a set of rules, conventions, and data structures that dictate how devices exchange data across networks.
Network protocols control all aspects of network communication from sending and receiving messages, to formatting files for different types of messages.
Similar to the way that speaking the same language simplifies communication between two people, network protocols make it possible for devices to interact with each other because of predetermined rules built into devices’ software and hardware.
A network protocol will specify, for example:
•	The format of data packets.
•	The addressing system.
•	Error-checking procedures used.

 

HTTP Protocol
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted. It also determines what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.
For example, when you enter a URL in your browser, this sends an HTTP command to the Web server asking it to fetch and transmit the requested Web page.
The HTTP request contains different types of methods to pick out the desired action from the server.
The most common methods are:
•	GET: to retrieve data from the server.
•	POST: to submit data to the server.
•	PUT: to update data that’s already on the server.
•	DELETE: to delete data from the server.
 




Internet Protocol
The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol, or set of rules, for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Data traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called packets. IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps routers to send packets to the right place. Every device or domain that connects to the Internet is assigned an IP address, and as packets are directed to the IP address attached to them, data arrives where it is needed.
Once the packets arrive at their destination, they are handled differently depending on which transport protocol is used in combination with IP. The most common transport protocols are TCP and UDP.

Introduction
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface. It is a software intermediary that allows two applications to speak to each other.
An API is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another. It also contains the terms of this data exchange.
APIs serve numerous purposes. Generally, they can simplify and speed up software development.
Whenever you use an application like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.

What Are the Advantages of APIs?
"There is no information exchange without an API. There is no digital transformation without an API. The Open API is the real revolution!" - Bertrand Lafforgue, > Microsoft Commercial Data Platform Director.
•	Automation: With APIs, computers rather than people can manage the work. Using APIs, agencies can update workflows to make them faster and more productive.
•	Application: APIs can access application components. The delivery of services and information is more flexible.
•	More scope: Through the use of an API an application layer can be created which can also be used to distribute information and services to new users. These APIs can be customized to create personalized user experiences.
•	Unlimited access to Data: An API allows all public information that is generated by the government for general use to be accessible to all citizens without any exclusivity.
•	Efficiency: When access is provided to an API, the generated content can be published automatically and is available for each channel. It makes it easier to share and distribute.
•	Integration: APIs make it easier to embed content from any site or application. This ensures smoother information flow and an integrated user experience.
•	Personalization: Thanks to APIs any user or company can personalize the content and services they use the most.
•	Adaptation: Needs evolve and APIs allow you to anticipate changes. When working with this technology data transfer is easily supported and the information is examined more closely.
Basically, APIs are developer-friendly, easily accessible, and incredibly flexible.
REST API
REST (Representational State Transfer) is a very popular web API architecture. REST API is an API that must have certain architectural constraints or principles including:
•	Client-server architecture: The interface is separated from the backend and data storage. This allows for flexibility and for different components to evolve independently.
•	Statelessness: No client context is stored on the server between requests.
•	Cacheability: Clients can cache responses, so a REST API response must explicitly state whether it can be cached or not.
•	Layered system: The API will work whether it is communicating directly with a server or through an intermediary, such as a load balancer.
The REST architecture uses the original instructions of the HTTP protocol.
Rule # 1: The URL must operate as a resource identifier.
Rule # 2: HTTP verbs must function as the identifiers of operations.
Rule # 3: HTTP responses must operate as representations of resources.
Rule # 4: Links are like a relationship between resources.
Rule # 5: A parameter, like an authentication token, must exist.

 

HTTP Methods
HTTP methods define a set of query methods that indicate the action that we want to perform on the indicated resource. Although they have names, these methods are often called HTTP verbs. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common functionalities can be shared by different methods.
GET: The GET method requests a representation of the indicated resource. GET requests should only be used to retrieve data.
HEAD: The HEAD method requests a response identical to a GET request but the body of the response is omitted (we only have the header).
POST: The POST method is used to send an entity to the indicated resource. This usually results in a change of state or causes side effects on the server.
PUT: The PUT method replaces all current representations of the resource targeted by the content of the request.
DELETE: The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
CONNECT: The CONNECT method builds a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
OPTIONS: The OPTIONS method is used to describe the communication options with the targeted resource.
TRACE: The TRACE method performs a round trip test message by following the path of the targeted resource.
PATCH: The PATCH method is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
Definition of a Database
Databases are systematic collections of data.
Databases support the storage and manipulation of data.
Databases simplify data management.
Let's take Facebook as an example. A social media platform needs to store, manipulate, and present data to its members. It also needs to provide data to the whole network of friends including their activities, their messages, their likes, and much more. If we stored all this data in files, it would be next to impossible to utilize it.
Fortunately, this is where databases come into play.
 

Why Do We Need a Database ?
 

Today, companies have to manage large volumes of data while also ensuring data integrity, security, and accuracy.
Spreadsheets are great tools for making calculations and inputting data. But if there’s a requirement to store substantial amounts of data such as customers’ information, employee records, or business inventory, a more efficient data management tool could be the better option.
In today’s digital age, substituting spreadsheets with databases is a sure-fire way for business growth.
Types of Databases:
There are many different types of databases. The best database for a specific organization depends on the organization’s purposes, plans, and projects.
These are the database types:
•	Relational databases
•	Object-oriented databases
•	Distributed databases
•	Data warehouses
•	NoSQL databases
•	Graph databases
•	OLTP databases
Database History :
The history of databases dates back to the 1960s with the appearance of network databases and hierarchical databases. The next era, in the 1980s, saw the appearance of object-oriented databases. Today, the most used databases are SQL, NoSQL and cloud databases.
In this skill, we’ll talk more about SQL and NoSQL databases.
What Is SQL?
SQL stands for "Structured Query Language".
It's a language that allows communication with databases to properly manage its data.
Is SQL a Programming Language?
•	Yes, SQL is a language. It offers looping, logic directives, variables, and so on. However, it’s not a language in the same sense as Java or C++.
•	SQL may not be a language compared to Java or C#, but it is a language nonetheless.
•	According to W3Schools: “SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.”
 

How is SQL used?
While an application might be programmed in a language like Python, PHP, or Ruby, databases are not designed to recognize these languages. Historically, databases recognize only SQL (although this has changed significantly in recent years).
Similar to programming languages, SQL has its own markup. This makes it a priority for a programmer to learn SQL markup before using it effectively.
Besides markup, another feature unique to database programming is the concept of tables. A database may be represented as a number of tables. Each table has its own number of columns and rows and represents a set of data.
Example of SQL Database Management
Imagine a library. We could create a database that stores data about students in the GoMyCode community. In this case, we would need only one table and this table would allow us to store all the information we need.
There are a few frequently used SQL commands you should be familiar with. When working with databases, a programmer might write commands such as:
•	CREATE DATABASE: to create a database.
•	CREATE TABLE: to create tables.
•	SELECT: to find/extract data from a database.
•	UPDATE: to make adjustments and edit data.
•	DELETE: to delete data.
These are just the most common commands. The more complicated the database is, the more commands you as the programmer will need to use.
•	Here is an example of a database table :
 

What Is NoSQL?
A NoSQL, which stands for “not only SQL,” originally referring to non SQL or non relational, is a database that provides a mechanism for the storage and retrieval of data.
NoSQL is an approach to database design that provides flexible schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures found in relational databases.
While NoSQL databases have existed for many years, it has recently become more popular in the era of cloud, big data, and high-volume web and mobile applications. They are chosen today for their attributes around scale, performance, and ease of use.
The most common types of NoSQL databases are key-value, document, column, and graph databases.

 
Examples of NoSQL Databases
Many NoSQL databases were designed by technology companies like Google, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook to provide more effective ways to store content or process data for huge websites. Some of the most popular NoSQL databases include the following:
•	Apache CouchDB:
An open-source, JSON document-based database that uses JavaScript as its query language.
•	Apache Cassandra:
An open-source, wide-column store database designed to manage large amounts of data across multiple servers and clustering that spans multiple data centers.
•	MongoDB:
An open-source document-based database that uses JSON-like documents and schema. It is the database component of the MERN stack.
•	Redis:
A powerful in-memory key-value store used for session caching, message queues, and other specific applications.
•	Elasticsearch:
A document-based database that includes a full-text search engine.

What’s the Difference Between SQL and NoSQL?
The fundamental difference between SQL and NoSQL is not that complicated. Each has a different philosophy for how data should be stored and retrieved.
1.	SQL databases are relational, NoSQL are non-relational.
2.	SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
3.	SQL databases are vertically scalable, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
4.	SQL databases are table based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, wide-column stores.
5.	SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, NoSQL are better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

Database Management System
A database typically requires a comprehensive database software program known as a Database Management System (DBMS).
A DBMS serves as an interface between the database and its end users or programs. It allows users to retrieve, update, and manage how the information is organized and optimized. A DBMS also facilitates oversight and control of databases, enabling a variety of administrative operations such as performance monitoring, tuning, backup, and recovery.
 
Using DBMS Allows Us to:
•	Securely store a large volume of data for long periods of time.
•	Access data efficiently.
•	Control access to data by multiple users at the same time. One user's actions should not affect the other.
•	Create new databases as well as specify their schemas.
•	Support a data model.
•	Query and modify the database’s data.
•	Have data redundancy.
•	Have more flexibility than the use of files.
•	Have data consistency and integrity.
The Most Known DBMS:
•	MySQL:
A free and open source DBMS. It is probably the best known DBMS. We will be using it in this section.
•	PostgreSQL:
A free and open source like MySQL but it has more functionality and it is a little less known.
•	SQLite:
A free and open source. It’s lightweight but extremely limited in functionality.
•	Oracle:
A paid database used by large companies. It is undoubtedly one of the most complete DBMSs.
•	Microsoft SQL Server:
Microsoft's DBMS. Microsoft markets at least a dozen different editions of its Microsoft SQL Server. They’re aimed at different audiences and for workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications that have many concurrent users.


What Is Web Development?
Web development is the process of building websites and applications for the Internet or for a private network known as an Intranet.
Web development is not only concerned with the design of a website. It’s also about the coding and programming that powers the website’s functionality.
From the simplest, most static web pages to social media platforms and applications and from E-commerce websites to content management systems (CMS), all the tools we use daily via the Internet have been built by web developers.
Web development can be broken down into three layers:
•	Client-side coding (front-end)
•	Server-side coding (back-end)
•	Database technology.
What Defines a Web Developer?
A web developer is by nature an interactive and creative artist. She/he is someone that is driven by a deep desire to create things. A web developer’s canvas is a user’s web browser.
Similar to a curious child who takes pleasure in making toys by joining LEGO blocks and then experiences a similar joy by taking them apart to see how they’re made, a web developer’s job is to use the basic building blocks of the Web (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to create something complex like a web page.
If it seems too complex, no need to sweat it!
We’ll break down these concepts shortly.

 

Types of Web Developers
Front-end Developer:
Client-side scripting, or front-end development, refers to everything that the end user experiences directly. Client-side code is executed on a web browser and directly relates to what people see when they visit a website. Things like layout, fonts, colors, menus, and contact forms are all designed by the front-end.
Back-end Developer:
Server-side scripting, or back-end development, is all about what goes on behind the scenes. The back-end is essentially the part of a website that the user doesn’t see. It is responsible for storing and organizing data and ensuring that everything on the client-side runs smoothly. It does this by communicating with the front-end. Whenever something happens on the client-side, like a user fills out a form, the browser sends a request to the server-side. The server-side “responds” with relevant information in the form of front-end code that the browser can then interpret and display.
Full Stack Developer:
A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software.
In addition to mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to:
•	Program a web page (like using JavaScript, jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue)
•	Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node)
•	Program a database (like using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)

The Skills of a Web Developer
What does it take to become a web developer?
Mainly, it requires the mastery of these three languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
They are the three pillars of web development, which we’ll be learning about over the next few weeks.
Collectively, these three pillars are what make a website function, by defining the content to be displayed (HTML), instructing a browser how to display that content (CSS), and making the content interactive (JavaScript).
A web developer is well-versed in these three technologies. They can read other people’s code and make changes to it. They can find and debug errors that are called “bugs”(shortcomings in existing code).
A web developer might, at times, work on a new project (a new website) from scratch, or may have to work on an existing website and make it better. A typical day in the life of a web developer involves fixing bugs, developing new features (enhancements) and web pages, and working with other developers to discuss ways to solve problems.
Don’t be overwhelmed by all of these details. You’ll soon see that they’re all very connected, and learning one of these languages automatically makes you better at a few others!
 

Creating a Website
There are two ways to create a website:
CMS (Content Management System) is an easy-to-use system that allows you to control and manage the content within your website without necessarily having technical skills.
You can easily add and delete images, links, presentation links, and other content on your website.
Hard Coding requires specific skills and knowledge of programming languages. That is the complex way to create a website and that is what web developers do.
In hard coding, you have the freedom to change what you want and build a custom website that completely satisfies the needs of the user, the employer, and the client.
What Is a CMS?
A CMS is software that helps users create, manage, and modify content on a website without the need for technical knowledge.
In simpler terms, a CMS is a tool that helps you build a website without needing to write all the code from scratch or even know how to code at all.
Instead of building your own system for creating web pages, storing images, and other functions, the CMS handles all the basic infrastructure tasks for you so that you can focus on more forward-facing parts of your website.
Besides websites, you can also find CMSs for other functions like document management.

The Most Known CMS Platform
The most known CMS Platforms are WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, Joomla!, Shopify, Drupal, Blogger, Prestashop, Magento, and Bitrix.
In the following section, we will talk about the two most common ones:
WordPress
WordPress is the best example of a popular CMS. While there are certainly other content management systems out there, WordPress maintains over 61% of the market share on websites with a known content management system.
 

Wordpress has an incredibly clear administration console and an abundance of menus. However, its configuration possibilities can put off some beginner users.
Experienced users can take advantage of all the possibilities of WordPress and transform a blog into a real showcase site, a portfolio or even an e-commerce site. Its versatility is a serious advantage compared to its competitors. There is also a large community of users and developers allowing you to find a multitude of resources (Template, module, plugin) to optimize and personalize your website.
Prestashop
 
Prestashop is an open-source CMS that allows you to create an online ecommerce store. The CMS can be modified, by adding modules available on the Prestashop platform, or developed artistically.
•	It is a preconceived and modular website. It is made up of two distinct parts:
o	The front office, or the front interface, is the part that’s visible to Internet users on the web.
o	The back office, also called the administration interface, is the part that’s only visible to the site administrator. This allows you to manage the content of the site.
What Kinds of Websites Can You Build with Content Management Systems?
Nowadays, most content management systems are pretty flexible. While there are a few that focus on a specific use – like Magento and eCommerce – most of the popular content management systems can be used to create essentially any type of website.
For example, you can use WordPress to power:
•	Static websites
•	Blogs
•	E-commerce stores
•	Forums
•	Social networks
•	Online courses
•	Membership sites
•	Portfolios
How Is a CMS Website Made?
To build a website with a CMS, the proper steps to take are as follows:
1.	Pick a Platform: Prior to launching a website, choose the CMS that best suits your web development needs and final expectations.
2.	Install the CMS: The next step is to install the platform you’ve chosen. Generally, the installation process is easy, intuitive, and takes only a couple of minutes.
3.	Choose and install the plugins: Almost all of the reputable CMSs require plugin installation, so it makes sense to do that right from the start. Plugins add functionality to your project. However, if you don’t plan on launching a full-featured complicated project, you can continue without them.
4.	Customize the design: As soon as you are done with plugin installation, it’s a priority to pick a suitable theme and customize your website design. Almost all CMS come with integrated templates, but you can also come across multiple variants on the web.
5.	Upload content: When you are done with web design customization, you can start uploading the content. Most templates contain pre-designed content that is customized for its specific purpose. You can replace the content with your own info (images, text, media files etc.) to get a unique, personalized project.
6.	Go online:The final step is website publication.

Create a Website with code
Setting Up Your Developer Environment
For this course, we’ll need three tools that every web developer uses:
1.	A text editor to write code.
2.	A web browser to preview what we’re building.
3.	A version control and Repository Manager (Git & Github).
While you can use any web browser or text editor, we recommend using Google Chrome and VSCode for this course.

Like any good craftsperson, it’s important that you become familiar with your tools. In order to do so, we’ll have a look at what is at our disposal.
Google Chrome : is a web browser. You may or may not already be using Google Chrome for browsing the web. A web browser allows us to view web pages (similar to the one you’re reading this very text on). We’ll use Google Chrome to view the results after writing and making changes to our code.
Visual Studio Code : is a popular code editor. A code editor is a very aptly named software; it helps us edit text. It is similar to the default text editor that comes preinstalled on Mac or Windows, but has additional features like code highlighting to enhance our coding and debugging experience.

 


Code Editor (IDE)
If you’re going to do any kind of development, you’re going to spend a lot of time in front of a text editor. There are many coding languages on the web, but let’s focus on the big three (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) and setup our environment to manipulate them.
Visual Studio Code (or VSCode) is the most used text editor.
VSCode provides a ton of plugins that make a developer’s life as easy as possible. When you’re using it, you have the ability to make it fit your preferences by installing the right plugins.
The plugins that you’re using have a huge impact on your productivity and the way you work.
 
VSCode Extensions
Here are some examples of what you can achieve with an Extension API:
Prettier
Prettier is one of the best plugins for developers who need to follow a well-laid set of rules when developing. It’s a robust opinionated code formatter that allows developers to format their codes in a structured way.
Prettier works together with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Markdown, and other modern tools and allows you to properly format your code. Link
Themes
Since you’ll be looking at your editor every day, why not make it as pretty as possible? There are tons of customization plugins that change the color scheme and the icons in the sidebar. Some popular themes that are available for free are One Monokai, One Dark Pro, and Material Icon. link
Bracket Pair Colorizer
This extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colours. The user can define which characters to match, and which colours to use. Link
Create Your First Sample Web Page
Follow the next steps to create your first web page in this track:
Create a file and name it whatever you want with the extension .html: which is a markup language of a web page. We will learn more about HTML in the next super skill.
Open this file with VSCode, copy and paste the next few lines:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Page Title</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Woooohooow this is my first page :)</h1>
		<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	</body>
</html>
Save the changes and then open it with your browser and this is your first basic web page. There is still a long way to go since we have a lot more to add. Our next steps would be to make it look better and style it using CSS. Afterward, we will make it interactive and user-friendly using Javascript. You’ll learn this in the upcoming super skills.
Organizing Your Work
One of the fundamentals of web development is organization. In order to achieve that, here is the folder creation step-by-step that we’ll use during our session:
1.	Create a folder named “GoMyCode” on your Desktop.
2.	Create a new folder in GoMyCode folder and name it whatever you want.
3.	Create a new folder inside that one and name it "res".
4.	Create a new folder inside that one and name it "css".
5.	Create a new folder inside that one and name it "js".
6.	Create a new text file, name it "index", and change its extension to ".html".
7.	Inside the "css" folder, create a new text file, name it "style", and change its extension to ".css".
8.	Inside the "js" folder, create a new text file, name it "main" and change its extension to ".js".
